title: "Information fractal dimension of Random Permutation Set"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Information_fractal_dimension_of_Random_Permutation_Set
excerpt: 'Inspired by the RÃ©nyi information dimension, this paper proposed the information dimension of the permutation mass function in Random permutation Set (RPS), and found the information dimension corresponding to the maximum RPS entropy is 2, which is equivalent to the fractal dimension of Brownian motion and Peano curve.'
