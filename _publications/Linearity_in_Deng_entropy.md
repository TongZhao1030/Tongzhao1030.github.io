excerpt: 'This paper conducts an in-depth exploration of the linear relationship between Deng entropy and the scale of the frame of discernment (SFOD), and find that the slope is nothing else but the information fractal dimension of mass function. It shows that entropy can not only increase but also increase in a linear way, which leads to the convenience of approximate calculation.'
