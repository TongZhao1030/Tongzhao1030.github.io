permalink: /publication/Linearity_in_Deng_entropy
excerpt: 'This paper conducts an in-depth exploration of the linear relationship between Deng entropy and the scale of the frame of discernment (SFOD), and find that the slope is nothing else but the information fractal dimension of mass function. It shows that entropy can not only increase, but also increase in a linear way, leading to the convenience of approximate calculation.'

Highlights
=====
- The linearity in Deng entropy is systematically reviewed and discussed.
- The slope of Deng entropy is the information fractal dimension of mass function.
- A set of mass functions which can result linearity in Deng entropy are presented.
- For any given slope from 0 to ln 3/ln 2, at least one mass function can be derived.
- Some proofs, numerical examples and discussions are presented.
